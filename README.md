Project Overview
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease worldwide, affecting millions of people. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve health outcomes for patients. This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning algorithms trained on diagnostic data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Dataset
The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle. This dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)
